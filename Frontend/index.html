          <h3>Description</h3>
          <p>
            Mario Trivia is a webapp that allows a user to play a 5 question
            trivia game on the subject of Mario. I utilized Asyncronus
            JavaScript to keep track of time by decrementing a number inside
            an object. Score is checked when a user clicks finish. If the
            value of selected option is equal to correct value, then
            correctScore is incremented. If it is not equal, then the
            incorrect score is incremented. At the end of the game all values
            are set back to original.
          </p>

          <h3>Challenges</h3>
          <p>
            Trying to follow the logic of the game in JavaScript vs real life
            was mind bending. I was able to discover how to "think like a
            coder" from this project.
          </p>
          </br>
          <p>
            Learning setInterval and setTimeout led me down a path of
            discovering Asynchronus JavaScript. It was weird to understand and
            harder to implement, but by the end of it I even understood how
            the JS Call Stack works.
          </p>
          </br>
          <p>
            Keeping track of the score was interesting because I didn't really
            understand how the number was going to be there throughout the
            game. From this curiosity I learned more about memory and how
            JavaScript runs in the browser.

          <h3>Description</h3>
          <p>
            Psychic Game is a JS based web app. Users click the start button, then begin guessing the hidden word
            by typing with their keyboard. Each key stroke is displayed until the correct letter is guessed or until
            10 guesses have been made. If a user reachs 10 guesses then the losses score is incremented. If a user
            correctly guesses the letter, then the wins score is incremented. In both scenarios guesses remaining,
            guesses
            made, and the letter to be guesses is reset. A user may quit the game by clicking the "quit" button. The
            quit button
            removes the onkeyup event listener and clears all stats.

          <h3>Challenges</h3>
          <p>
            Learning OOP was the biggest struggle in this project. I'm lucky it was a small project otherwise I think
            this would've taken a long time.
            I was able to understand the major differences in Functional code vs Object Oriented code.
          </p>
          </br>
          <p>
            Styling with Bootstrap made me try to come up with a more complex/ fancier UI.
            Learning the syntax was frustrating but once I became familiar I really enjoyed the power behind a CSS
            library.
          </p>
          </br>
          <p>
            The game was so small I took a long time to create different features and make the app more fun to
            interact with. Being creative and going outside my comfort zone is easily the most adventurous part of
            coding.
